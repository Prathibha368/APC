# APC Calculator in C (Arbitrary Precision Calculator)

An Arbitrary Precision Calculator implemented in C using Doubly Linked Lists.
This project supports mathematical operations on very large numbers that cannot be handled by standard data types.

## 📌 Features

- Supports large integer calculations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (x / X)
- Division (/)
- Handles positive and negative numbers
- Uses Doubly Linked List for number storage
- Command-line based interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: C
- Data Structure: Doubly Linked List
- Compiler: GCC
- Platform: Linux / Windows (WSL)

📚 **Key Learnings**

Gained strong understanding of Doubly Linked Lists and their practical usage.

Learned how to implement arbitrary precision arithmetic without using built-in data types.

Improved knowledge of pointer handling and dynamic memory allocation in C.

Understood how to manage carry and borrow operations manually.

Learned to implement long division algorithm using linked lists.

Enhanced debugging skills by fixing segmentation faults and memory leaks.

📝 **Notes**

This project works only with integer values.

Floating-point and decimal calculations are not supported.

Input numbers can be of any length, limited only by system memory.

Proper input format must be followed:
./apc <operand1> <operator> <operand2>

Supported operators are: +, -, x, X, /.

Leading zeros in input are removed automatically.
